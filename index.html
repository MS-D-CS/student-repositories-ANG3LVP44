         Internet Explorer is EVIL!!! ---- Verdana Supremacy ---- Bill Gates Is My Dad ----
         Nintendo DS Rumors are TRUE??? ---- If Your Forum Post Count is Under 5000, What Are You Even
         Doing On The Internet? ---- LOVE WIN XP, HATE "ME" and 2000!!! ---- Firefox Is The New
         Netscape Navigator ---- Expand Your VHS Collection TODAY!!! Down With CD!!! ----
         "Online Gaming" is a BAD Idea, Just Go To Your Friend's House (Costs Less than AOL.... LOL!)
         ---- I Didn't Buy the "X-Box", And Neither Should You ---- HTML3 Supremacy ---- If You
         Can't See This Marquee, You Probably Suck ---- Why Aren't You Using Geocities? ---- I'm Not
         Sure What This "Web 2.0" Thing Is, But It Sounds Very Scary ---- I Don't Care Who Wins the
         2004 Election, As Long As The Convenience Store Down The Road Still Sells Wild Cherry Pepsi
         ---- Take Your Fancy Formatting Somewhere Else ---- Yes, I Import EDM Straight From Italy
         ---- Quit E-Mailing Me Russian Trance ---- Revive Dead Forums TODAY!!! ---- Keep This One
         Bookmarked, Nerds ---- WebTV is NOT for ME!!! ----
